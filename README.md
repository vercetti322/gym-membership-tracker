# Gym Membership Tracker

A small, private dashboard for managing gym memberships and tracking plan renewals and payments. The app runs on Cloudflare Workers, with a React interface and a D1 database.

## Features

- Password-protected access with session cookies.
- Create members with a phone number, membership dates, and payment method.
- Search and browse active members, and filter members whose plans are due or expired.
- Renew plans or deactivate members; membership and payment history is retained.
- Refresh member data without reloading the page.

## Stack

- React 19, TypeScript, Vite, Mantine
- Hono API on Cloudflare Workers
- Cloudflare D1 (SQLite)

## Run locally

Requirements: Node.js and npm.

```bash
npm install
```

Set the local admin password in a root-level `.dev.vars` file:

```dotenv
ADMIN_PASSWORD=choose-a-local-password
```

Apply the database migrations and start the development server:

```bash
npm run db:migrate
npm run dev
```

Open the local URL printed by Vite (usually <http://localhost:5173>) and sign in with the password from `.dev.vars`.

Optional: load sample members into the local database:

```bash
npm run db:seed
```

**Warning:** `seed.sql` deletes existing member and plan-history rows before inserting sample data. Use it only when it is safe to reset the local database.

## Deploy

The Wrangler configuration points to the `gym-tracker-db` D1 database. Before deploying, make sure it belongs to your Cloudflare account and is configured in `wrangler.json`.

Apply remote migrations, set the admin password as a Worker secret, then build and deploy:

```bash
npm run db:migrate:remote
npx wrangler secret put ADMIN_PASSWORD
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

Wrangler will prompt for the secret value. Do not commit `.dev.vars` or passwords to source control.

## Useful commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Start the local Vite/Workers development environment |
| `npm run build` | Type-check and build the Worker and client |
| `npm run preview` | Build and preview the production app locally |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint |
| `npm run check` | Build and run a Wrangler deployment dry run |
| `npm run db:migrate` | Apply migrations to the local D1 database |
| `npm run db:migrate:remote` | Apply migrations to the configured remote D1 database |
| `npm run db:seed` | Reset and seed the local database |
| `npm run db:seed:remote` | Reset and seed the remote database — destructive |

## API

Login and logout are public endpoints. All other `/api/*` routes require a valid session.

| Method | Route | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST` | `/api/login` | Sign in with the admin password |
| `POST` | `/api/logout` | End the current session |
| `GET` | `/api/auth/me` | Verify the current session |
| `GET` | `/api/members` | List active members with their latest plan |
| `GET` | `/api/members/:id` | Get a member |
| `POST` | `/api/members` | Create a member and initial plan |
| `POST` | `/api/members/:id/renewals` | Add a plan renewal |
| `PATCH` | `/api/members/:id` | Deactivate a member |

## Data model

- `member_details` stores each member and whether they are active.
- `member_plan_audit` stores plan and payment records; each renewal adds a record rather than overwriting history.
- `sessions` stores expiring session-token hashes.

Migrations are in `migrations/`. The local and remote database commands use the D1 binding configured in `wrangler.json`.
